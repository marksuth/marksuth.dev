# marksuth.dev

Repo for my personal site built using Laravel and various other things.

This readme, like the rest of of this is a work in progress.

## Documentation

Yeah about that... If you're familiar with Laravel great!

I've got a couple more things to sort out, but there'll be some more useful docs here when I get round to writing them.
